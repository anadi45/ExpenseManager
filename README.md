# EXPENSE MANAGER

In this project I have created a web application to keep track of all personal expenses made by a user. It has the basic functionalities of login, signup, adding expenses, setting budget etc. A user can update the budget according to his requirements anytime and delete any of the expenses. User can also check remarks provided and pie-chart visualization for better experience.
New password is mailed in case a user forgets password. Name and password can be changed in the account settings.
Navigation Bar has been added for ease of navigation between pages along with source code hyperlink in the footer section.
